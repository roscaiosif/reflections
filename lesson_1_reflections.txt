1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
I think that it is far more energy an nerve saver to find this way a bug than browsing through the files

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Again it saves lot of time comapared with using a file browser...

3.What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
pros: minimum number of commits each with a logical change
cons: need extra time 

4.Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Beacuse those files are closly related forming a repository

5.How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
well...If I don't mind browsing the commits, I would say quite confident

6. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
to versionify my html+css programs 

7. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Creates the .git file and ...and waits for commits
